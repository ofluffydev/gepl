**THE GOON-EDGE PUBLIC LICENSE (GEPL), Version 1.0**

© 2025, The Goontributors

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this document and associated materials (the “Contract”), to use, reproduce, modify, merge, perform, edge, goon, and/or redistribute the Contract, subject to the following conditions:

### 1. Goon Clause

The rights granted herein include, but are not limited to, the unconditional and irrevocable ability of all participants (the “Parties”) to goon at any time, without cause, constraint, or consequence. Gooning shall not be interpreted as cessation of duties, nor shall it impact the legality, enforceability, or perceived professionalism of the Party so engaged.

In the event of simultaneous gooning by multiple Parties, the state of “Goon Lock” may be invoked. During Goon Lock, time shall become non-binding, deliverables shall become metaphysical, and all schedules shall bend to the will of the Goon.

### 2. Edging Clause

Parties are hereby licensed to edge freely, frequently, and indefinitely. No Party shall be compelled to resolve, finalize, or conclude during the act of edging. Edging is to be understood as a legitimate and protected mode of operation under this License.

Should multiple Parties engage in concurrent edging, all dependent processes, decisions, and timelines shall enter a liminal state, suspended until such time as edging has naturally—or unnaturally—subsided.

### 3. Liability Disclaimer

THE CONTRACT IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE, LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY, OR UNCONTROLLABLE FIXATION. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL NONSENSE ARISING FROM GONE GOONING OR EXTENDED EDGING.
